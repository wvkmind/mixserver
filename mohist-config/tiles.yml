# Welcome to Mohist tile tick configuration!
# This opens up good TPS savings if used wisely.
# 'overrides' section populates itself over time.
# -=-=-=-=-
# Simple usage cases:
# 'skip-every: 50' - skips every 50th tick
# 'skip-every: 0' - tick limiter is not applied (vanilla behaviour)
# 'skip-every: 1' - tile will not tick at all (skips every 1st tick)
# 'skip-every: default' - value is grabbed from 'defaults' section
# Values in range of 0 up to 1000 can be used, you won't need more than that.
